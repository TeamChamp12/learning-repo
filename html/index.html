                    A social networking site is an online platform that allows users to create a public profile and
                    interact with other users. Social networking sites usually allow a new user to provide a list of
                    people with whom they share a connection, and then allow the people on the list to confirm or deny
                    the connection. After connections are established, the new user can search the networks of
                    connections to make more connections.

                    A social networking site is also known as a social networking website or social website.

                    The difference between the two things is that social media is mainly used for communications, while
                    social networking is used to build that network of people. Some people also consider "social media"
                    to be a noun, just like digital media or print media, and "social networking" to be a verb.
                    So the social networking part of Facebook would be its groups, where people add each other in a
                    grouped network deliberately. The social media component would be someone's page or wall where the
                    communications are evidently public and accessible to all users without a specific network in mind.
