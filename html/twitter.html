                    Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact
                    with messages known as "tweets". Registered users can post, like and retweet tweets, but
                    unregistered users can only read them. Users access Twitter through its website interface or its
                    mobile-device application software ("app"), though the service could also be accessed via SMS before
                    April 2020. Twitter, Inc. is based in San Francisco, California, and has more than 25 offices
                    around the world. Tweets were originally restricted to 140 characters, but was doubled to 280
                    for non-CJK languages in November 2017. Audio and video tweets remain limited to 140 seconds for
                    most accounts.

                    Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and
                    launched in July of that year. By 2012, more than 100 million users posted 340 million tweets a
                    day, and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search queries per day.[17][18][19] In
                    2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been described as "the SMS of the
                    Internet". As of 2018, Twitter had more than 321 million monthly active users.[10] Twitter is a
                    some-to-many microblogging service, given that the vast majority of tweets are written by a small
                    minority of users.

                    Twitter's usage spikes during prominent events. For example, a record was set during the 2010 FIFA
                    World Cup when fans wrote 2,940 tweets per second in the thirty-second period after Japan scored
                    against Cameroon on June 14. The record was broken again when 3,085 tweets per second were posted
                    after the Los Angeles Lakers' victory in the 2010 NBA Finals on June 17,[46] and then again at the
                    close of Japan's victory over Denmark in the World Cup when users published 3,283 tweets per
                    second.[47] The record was set again during the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup Final between Japan and
                    the United States, when 7,196 tweets per second were published
