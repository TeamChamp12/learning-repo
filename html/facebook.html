                    Facebook (stylized as facebook) is an American online social media and social networking service
                    based in Menlo Park, California, and a flagship service of the namesake company Facebook, Inc. It
                    was founded by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo
                    Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.

                    The founders of Facebook initially limited membership to Harvard students. Membership was expanded
                    to Columbia, Stanford, and Yale before being expanded to the rest of the Ivy League, MIT, and higher
                    education institutions in the Boston area, then various other universities, and lastly high school
                    students.

                    A "face book" is a student directory featuring photos and personal information.[18] In 2003, Harvard
                    had only a paper version along with private online directories. Zuckerberg told The
                    Harvard Crimson, "Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard. ... I
                    think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I
                    can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week." In January 2004, Zuckerberg coded a
                    new website, known as "TheFacebook", inspired by a Crimson editorial about Facemash, stating, "It is
                    clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available ... the
                    benefits are many."

                    In March 2012, Facebook announced App Center, a store selling applications that operate via the
                    website. The store was to be available on iPhones, Android devices, and for mobile web users.[64]


                    Billboard on the Thomson Reuters building welcomes Facebook to NASDAQ, May 2012
                    Facebook's initial public offering came on May 17, 2012, at a share price of US$38. The company was
                    valued at $104 billion, the largest valuation to that date. The IPO raised $16 billion, the
                    third-largest in U.S. history, after Visa Inc. in 2008 and AT&T Wireless in 2000.[68][69] Based on
                    its 2012 income of $5 billion, Facebook joined the Fortune 500 list for the first time in May 2013,
                    ranked 462. The shares set a first day record for trading volume of an IPO (460 million shares).
